I'm back and ready to get down to practicing data analytics. This year has been extremely unpredictable. My social, physical and work life has strained by COVID-19 and I am finally coming up for air. 
This is all thanks to taking the time I needed to breath and stay still. There is great power in taking the time to stay still and listen for silence. You would think with COVID taking humans out of busy downtowns that there would be an abundance of silence. Well... that's not the kind of silence I am talking about.
I am talking about mental silence, you can be in the busiest part of your home but you decide to stop what you are doing to take 2 minutes to listen to your breath. After sitting for 2 minutes noticing what shows up in your mind and letting it go. Then doing it again until you feel at peace with the motion of your thoughts. A simple yet powerful practice. 
My clear line of thought happens in the morning so I will continue to work on my personal projects at this time. To see my progress feel free to look into my Personal Projects folder in github.
