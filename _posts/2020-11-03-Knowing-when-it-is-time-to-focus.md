I have come to realize that there are limits to my energy expenditure. I gain most of my energy from interacting with other people however the current pandemic has limited that. Outdoor activities are not ideal as it gets colder in Toronto so I am left with what else gives me 
energy and fits the criteria:

    - Indoor Activity
    - Simulated Social interaction

You guessed it... DATA ANALYTICS!

I have come up with a solution, I will be posting at this time everyday on the Data Analytics project of the day. The social platforms I'll be using is are Twitter and Kaggle.
