Whenever I start something new, I take time to reflect on how I am experiencing my thoughts, emotions and physical sensations. I want to take the time to acknowledge the present moment and that involves being in it.

This practice is as old as time and different cultures call it by different names like mindfulness, self-awareness, kujijua, contemplation just to name a few. I encountered it in the Western Hemisphere through Buddhist Psychology at University and I was appreciative for it because I am able to practice being a human BEING not a human DOING. 

As I breathe this blog to life, I will be making space to plan for topics such as time management, practicing python to automate repetitive tasks, setting boundaries, iterative problem solving, resiliency, code design and many more
