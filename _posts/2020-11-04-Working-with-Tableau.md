I have switched to the Mac enviornment to expand my skillset in different operating systems. I have encountered challenges like opening Tableau in Mac is very specific. 

For example, when I am looking to open a csv in the PC environment, I can select Excel files and I have the option of picking csv files or xls files. However on Mac, I need to select csv files specifically and if the file is stored in Google Drive I need to connect to the server first then select the specific file I want to upload. 

That's my lesson for the day. See you tomorrow
