My name is Mary and I was formally trained in Neuroscience and the philosophical underpinings of Artificial Intelligence.The one concept that I took away from my degree is neuroplasticity, a term that means our brains adapt to the changing environment we place it in.

Neuroplasticity combined with a growth mindset has led me to searching for new challanges intellectually and physically.
I created this blog to chronicle my steps as I learn more about data analysis and how to make business decisions based on meaningful information.

My love for long distance cycling will also show up especially during this time of Covid-19 as I challenge myself to ride 75km on June 7th 2020 in support of Ride for Heart and 200km on August 29th 2020 in support of Ride to Conquer Cancer.
