My name is Mary and I was formally trained in Neuroscience and the philosophical underpinings of Artificial Intelligence.The one concept that I took away from my degree is neuroplasticity, a term that means our brains adapt to the changing environment we place it in.

Neuroplasticity combined with a growth mindset has led me to search for new challanges intellectually and physically.
I created this blog to document and share my steps as I learn more about data analysis and how to make business decisions based on meaningful information.

My love for long distance cycling has shown up during this pandemic as a gentle ride and spending time to appreciate. I look forward to next season to pick up where I left off pre-pandemic
